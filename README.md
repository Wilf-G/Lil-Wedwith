Methodology chosen: Scrum, due to its easily adaptable nature, and perfect layout for desgining a project in increments, like what is being done here. As part of this methodology, we rotated who had the title of scrum master rotate on a weekly basis, and updated eachother frequently on project progress, alongside weekly scrums (meetings).

Initiation Phase:

-We quizzed the client on preferences regarding accessibility, design, and desired functionality of the website. This allowed us to work with more detailed requirements, such as:
  -Alternative text being utilised alongside a screen reader, to assist blind and partially sighted customers of Food INC.
  -A predominantly Red, Purple and White colour scheme, to represent simplicity, and healthy eating.
  -A logo of a large fork, present for branding.
  -Stock data is to be stored in an excel spreadsheet.
  -A menu page, where food, and alterations can be selected.
  -Python application needs a login function to authorise staff.
  -34 Tables must be accounted for if the user selects to order in-store
  -Allergy information should always be present when relevant.
  -Chefs will be able to see a table view of the restaurant and  have access to specific order tickets.

-We then set up this repository to communicate, share files, and allow real-time local web hosting to assist with development.

Planning phase:

-We created a planning document, Including 4 sets of High-Fidelity wireframes, to represent the layout of the front-facing HTML application. These also included elements of responsive design, with a draft of a mobile-style layout, to allow the site to be used regardless of which devices the customers will have available. 

-We also made a flowchart to represent the UX of our Python system, which will allow staff to view and modify stock in accordance with orders made by customers. This included function names, which will later be developed, in a top-down development approach.
